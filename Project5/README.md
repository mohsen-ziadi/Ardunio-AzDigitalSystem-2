## How to Run

1. Open the provided `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
3. Run the Proteus simulation and observe the LCD displaying the custom message.

Make sure the connections follow the correct pin mapping between the Arduino and the LCD (usually RS, EN, D4-D7).
